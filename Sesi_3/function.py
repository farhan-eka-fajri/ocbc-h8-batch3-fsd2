#Anonymous function = lambda
# These functions are called anonymous because they are not declared in the standard manner by using the def keyword. You can use the lambda keyword to create small anonymous functions.
# lambda forms can take any number of arguments but return just one value in the form of an expression. They cannot contain commands or multiple expressions.
# An anonymous function cannot be a direct call to print because lambda requires an expression
# lambda functions have their own local namespace and cannot access variables other than those in their parameter list and those in the global namespace.
# The syntax of lambda functions contains only a single statement, which is as follows âˆ’

# Function definition is here
sum = lambda arg1, arg2: arg1 + arg2

# That lambda function will be equal to :
# def sum(arg1, arg2):
#     return arg1+arg2

# Now you can call sum as a function
print("Value of total : ", sum( 10, 20 ))
print("Value of total : ", sum( 20, 20 ))

#Return statement 
# The statement return [expression] exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A return statement with no arguments is the same as return None.
# All the above examples are not returning any value. You can return a value from a function as follows.
# Function definition is here
def sum(arg1, arg2):
    # Add both the parameters and return them."
    total = arg1 + arg2
    return total

# Now you can call sum function
total = sum(10, 20)
print("Result function : ", total)

# Global vs. Local variables

# Variables that are defined inside a function body have a local scope, and those defined outside have a global scope.

# This means that local variables can be accessed only inside the function in which they are declared, whereas global variables can be accessed throughout the program body 
# by all functions. 
# When you call a function, the variables declared inside it are brought into scope.

# Declare a global variable
total = 0

# Create sum function
def sum( arg1, arg2 ):
   total = arg1 + arg2; 
   print("Inside the function local total   : ", total)
   return total

# Call a function
print("Outside the function global total - before : ", total)
total = sum( 10, 20 )
print("Outside the function global total - after  : ", total)



# A docstring is a string literal that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. Such a docstring becomes the __doc__ special attribute of that object.
# All modules should normally have docstrings, and all functions and classes exported by a module should also have docstrings.
# For consistency, always use '''triple single quotes''' or """triple double-quotes""" around docstrings.
# There is no strict rules how to write the docstring. You can write the docstring as you like. For clear explanation, Docstring usually contains 3 parts :

# Aims of a module, function, class, or method.
# Description of input parameter with their types.
# Description of output parameter (only if return something).

# Example of docstring in a function

def sum_number(num1, num2):
  '''
  This function is used to sum of 2 variables.
  :param num1: Input number 1 | int or float
  :param num2: Input number 2 | int or float
  
  :return: num3: Sum of number | int or float
  '''

  num3 = num1 + num2
